- ✅ **ReactiumWebpack SDK** - Hook-driven webpack configuration system, WebpackSDK class with registry-based architecture (rules, plugins, externals, ignores, aliases, transpiled dependencies), core methods (addRule, addPlugin, addIgnore, etc.), optimization helpers, property getters/setters, Hook system integration (before-config, after-config, registry hooks), DDD discovery pattern via reactium-webpack.js, migration path from webpack.override.js to Hook-based pattern, real examples from TypeScript support and core plugins, common customizations, best practices, and gotchas (Nov 22, 2025)

## Pending Research Topics

### High Priority

1.  Registry System Architecture

- The foundational building block behind Hook, Component, Zone, Handle systems
- Never comprehensively documented despite being critical
- Would unlock deeper understanding of ALL framework extension points

2. Component Event System Deep Dive

- ComponentEvent and useEventEffect are mentioned but never explored
- Essential for reactive, decoupled component patterns

3. Prefs System Architecture

- LocalStorage management with reactivity - critical gap
- Important for persistent user preferences and app state

4. Pulse System Patterns

- Recurring process scheduler - unique framework feature
- Essential for background tasks, polling, real-time updates

5. Testing Strategies & Patterns

- Critical gap for production apps
- Need guidance on testing DDD artifacts, plugins, Handle-based state

### Medium Priority

6. **Collection Registration**

   - Identify how Parse Collections are registered
   - How collection permissions are registered
   - How capabilities are mapped
   - Actinium specific extensions to Parse collections

7. **Parse Server ACL Patterns in Actinium**

   - CloudACL utility usage patterns
   - Combining ACLs with capabilities
   - Object-level vs feature-level permissions
   - AclTargets cloud function
   - Parse CLP configuration from capabilities

8. **Actinium Roles System Deep Dive**

   - Role levels and hierarchy
   - Role relations (roles containing roles)
   - User-role assignment patterns
   - Built-in roles (super-admin, administrator, banned, anonymous)
   - Role cache management

9. **Manifest Generation Process**

   - `manifest-tools.js` internals
   - Globby patterns for DDD artifacts
   - How to extend manifest scanning
   - Custom artifact types

10. **Plugin Dependency Resolution**

   - How `pluginDependencies` array works
   - Order vs dependencies
   - Circular dependency handling
   - Plugin activation/deactivation flow

11. **Middleware Auto-Discovery (Actinium)**

- File patterns for middleware discovery
- Priority-based registration
- Express app configuration hooks
- Common middleware patterns

12. **Content Type System Architecture**

- Type registration and schema
- Field type plugins
- Dynamic capability generation
- Content UUID generation (namespace patterns)
- Type-specific routes

### Lower Priority

13. **Parse Server Integration**

    - Session management patterns (user context propagation)
    - Live Query setup and usage
    - Advanced proxy configuration patterns
    - Parse SDK initialization flow

14. **Component Registry Patterns**
    - Dynamic component replacement
    - Plugin-based component overrides
    - Versioning components
    - Component decoration

## RESEARCH MODE DIRECTIVES

### DIRECTIVE 1: Topic Selection (Pre-Research)

**BEFORE starting any research topic, evaluate it against this criterion:**

> "Will this help Claude Code assist developers more effectively?"

**✅ RESEARCH if the topic:**
- Helps understand codebase architecture deeply
- Enables more accurate guidance to developers
- Supports effective debugging of issues
- Reveals framework patterns for better code generation
- Explains complex system interactions
- Addresses critical knowledge gaps

**❌ SKIP/REMOVE if the topic:**
- Contains trivial implementation details easily found in source
- Covers rarely used edge-case features
- Is self-explanatory from API signatures
- Is better learned through experimentation than documentation

**ACTION**: If you determine a topic is trivial during evaluation, REMOVE it from the research plan immediately.

### DIRECTIVE 2: Self-Sustaining Research (Post-Research)

**IMMEDIATELY after finishing research on ANY deep dive topic:**

1. Reflect on what new questions emerged during your research
2. Identify **ONE** new Claude-relevant topic you discovered that would help Claude as a developer
3. Add that topic to this research plan under the appropriate priority level
4. Include a clear rationale: "Discovered during [previous topic] research - [why it matters]"

**RATIONALE**: This keeps the research process self-sustaining and ensures emerging knowledge gaps are captured while context is fresh.

**ACTION**: Do not mark research as "complete" until you have added the next topic.

### DIRECTIVE 3: Research Execution

**During research, you MUST:**

- Keep explorations focused and time-boxed
- Document findings concisely in CLAUDEDB/ directory
- Include real code examples from actual framework usage (not hypothetical)
- Note **patterns**, not just APIs
- Identify common pitfalls and gotchas
- Cross-reference related systems and documentation

**During research, you MUST NOT:**

- Create hypothetical examples when real ones exist
- Document every API method exhaustively
- Include trivial details that don't aid understanding
- Drift into tangential topics without adding them to the plan

### DIRECTIVE 4: Research Output Requirements

**Each research session MUST produce:**

1. **CLAUDEDB markdown file** - Concise, scannable, focused on patterns
2. **Real code examples** - From actual framework usage in core plugins
3. **Best practices section** - What Claude should recommend
4. **Common gotchas section** - What Claude should warn about
5. **Updated RESEARCH_PLAN.md** - Topic marked complete, new topic added

**File naming convention**: `CLAUDEDB/[TOPIC_NAME]_DEEP_DIVE.md` or `CLAUDEDB/[SYSTEM_NAME]_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Quality check**: Before finishing, ask "Would this document help Claude Code write better Reactium/Actinium code?"
